# Our prompt

At Blunder Mifflin Paper Company, we have been relying on paper for all of our internal human resources. We believe in paper and as a member of this company so should you! However, we feel it is finally time to have our own website dedicated to internal human resources. Sometimes paper just can't cut it. (Get it? Paper, cut... I'll see mysel out) 
We want to focus on our internal departments and employees. We believe you have the power to bring us slightly into the future!


## What do we want to achieve?
