1. Box Model
    * `display: block;`
        * One box on top of another, not horizontally spaced
        * The box fills the available container space
        * width and height properties apply to boxes
    * `display: inline;`
        * One box next to another, only vertically spaced when they run out of room
        * In some circumstances, ignores padding and margins
    * `display: inline-block`
    * `Box-sizing:`
        * By default: `content-box;`
            * Width and height refer only to the content
            * The space a box takes up is actually the width + padding + border + margin
        * In CSS3: can be set to `border-box;`
            * Width and height refer to the entire space the box takes up, including content, padding, border, and margin.
